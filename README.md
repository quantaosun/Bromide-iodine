## This is an adaption of https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain/blob/main/Partial_Charges.ipynb written by https://github.com/pablo-arantes

In this version, we have modified code to define the radius of the bromide and iodine atoms so that this workflow can support molecules containing them.
